## Working Paper

### **[Do People Reduce Their Income for CHIP Eligibility? Evidence from Tax Returns](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5296310)**
This paper examines whether families reduce their reported income on tax returns in order to qualify for Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) eligibility. It uses tax-return data to look for clustering or “bunching” of incomes just below the income thresholds that determine CHIP eligibility, testing whether the incentives created by income cutoffs lead to behavioral responses in income reporting or labor supply.

### **Does Medicaid Expansion Lead to Income Adjustment? Evidence from the Survey of Income Program Participation**
Using monthly data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a regression discontinuity design around the 138 % of Federal Poverty Line eligibility cutoff in expansion states, this paper finds that childless adults reduced their lowest-month earnings by about 39 percentage points of the FPL (≈ US $700 for a two-person household) to qualify for Medicaid when the individual-mandate penalty was high, with the effect diminishing after the penalty dropped to zero. Adjustments occurred both via zero-earning months (extensive margin) and fewer hours worked (intensive margin).

## Work in Progress

### **The Elephant in the Room: What Has Been Missing in Determining Medicaid Eligibility?**
This in-progress project explores gaps or overlooked aspects in how eligibility for Medicaid is determined—such as administrative burden, income volatility, or state-level variation in verification procedures. It aims to identify factors often neglected in eligibility modeling and to propose how incorporating them can improve enrollment predictions and policy design.

### **Does Tracking Increase Grades Disparities?**
This work investigates the effect of academic tracking (grouping students by ability or level) on disparities in grades. It examines whether tracking contributes to widening achievement gaps between students of different socioeconomic backgrounds or prior achievement levels, quantifying the causal impact of tracking practices on grade disparities to inform education policy.
