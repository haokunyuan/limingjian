My research examines how government policies influence individual economic and health behaviors. I view
public policy as a powerful institutional force which can shape the lives of millions through even small design
changes. My current work studies how the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicaid
expansion affect individuals’ labor supply and health outcomes.
